             He is an 8 years old boy who likes to play all day. When asked about his favourite thing to do he giggled and said "Daudna".
             We naturally anticipated him to want to become an athlete when he grows up but to our surprise he said "Motorcycle Mistri". We taught him that its called being a 'Mechanic' and he was very excited to learn that new word.
             However when we met him again and asked the same question, he replied with 'Makaan Malik'. He wanted to have a pakka house for his parents and other five siblings more than anything else.

             Khushi has four more sisters. When asked about her date of birth,

             But the smile on her face never fades away. 
             She locks herself in a room and dances, where no one could watch her.
             When asked what she wants to become when she 
             grows up surprisingly she replied "I just want to dance. I want to become a dancer."

             A teacher like her Aaghaaz - e- Taleem teachers.
